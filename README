django-tyrant-cache is a alternative cache backend for Django. 

This cache backend was inspired by django-tokyo-persistent-store (http://github.com/thejefflarson/django-tokyo-persistent-store)  and django-redis-cache (http://github.com/sebleier/django-redis-cache)

This cache backend requires the pytyrant Python client library for communicating with the Tokyo Tyrant server.

Tokyo Tyrant is the de facto database server for Tokyo Cabinet written and maintained by the same author. It supports a REST HTTP protocol, memcached, and its own simple binary protocol.


Usage

Run python setup.py install to install, or place django-tyrant-cache on your Python path.

Modify your Django settings to use django-tyrant-cache

CACHE_BACKEND = 'tyrant_cache://<host>:<port>'
